## victory-native demo

Demos the [victory-native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native/) library for React Native.

```
git clone https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native-demo
cd victory-native-demo
npm install
```

To make the demo easy to use, it uses the [Expo](https://expo.io).
You can either [download the app](https://expo.io/tools) (it's free!) to test on a real device, or run on a simulator.

### `npm start` (requires Expo app)

Runs the demo in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload when you modify files, and you'll see any logs and errors in the terminal.

### `npm run ios` (requires iOS simulator)

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the demo in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### `npm run android` (requires Android emulator)

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the demo on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
